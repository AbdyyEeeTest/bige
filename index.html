        e, or E, is an old meme, and a way of expressing many different <br>
        emotions. Unlike other letters, especially "A," E can be used in a <br>
        variety of different situation. Just by the tone of your voice alone <br>
        you can express your thoughts with this one letter, and the other <br>
        person would understand what you are saying. E can even be used <br>
        in text.

        Looking at this image, you can see that I asked xD-F86 a question. <br>
        "@xD-F86 good?" He responded by saying E. This shows that E can <br> be used
        in casual yes/no answers, and in regular conversations that <br> take place
        everyday. <br>

        <br>To back this up with a credible source, according to Ram2424, formally known <br>
        as Ramyn2007, "First of all, the word yes contains the letter e, but the <br>
        word not does not contain the letter e. Secondly, the sound of the letter e <br>
        sounds more like you are trying to say yes and trying to agree with a statement <br>
        rather than saying no like you are disagreeing with something."

        <br><br>Compare this to other letters, such as "A". What does sayign A sound like? <br>
        Not much. A has a neutral type of sound, which means it does not have any <br>
        way of expressing thoughts or emotion. Furthermore, A is not as understandable <br>
        as e. This is due to the fact that it is not a commonly used letter. If someone <br>
        heard you saying A, they would be puzzled, and wonder... "What does A mean?"<br><br>

        You might say, if someone said E to someone, they would be confused as well. <br>
        This is somewhat true, but unlike A, E has more expression, which means the <br>
        person who was confused at why you said E, would be able to make an inference that <br>
        would allow them to at least guess what you meant by E.

        <br><br>You might not believe it but E is also apart of the arabic language. E can mean "yes." <br>
        In iraqi dialect, yes is known as "أي." If you were to pronounce this word, it would literally <br>
        mean "ee" or just "e." أي is not just some made up way to say yes, it is known by iraqi people.

        <p>Have you wondered what does making someone e mean?</p>
    </div>

<div class="paragraph">
    <p>
        Making someone e has many meanings in life... <br>
        Saying, "You are E!" can be good and bad.
        First off, the E <br> in "You are E!" has no meaning really.
        It just is E, you have <br> to interpert the tone to understand what it really means.
        <br> If someone says "You are E!" in an agressive tone, you know <br>
        that they are mad. But if they speak in a memeful, or happy tone, <br>
        you know that they are not mad.
